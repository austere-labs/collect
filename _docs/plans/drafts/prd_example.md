  ⎿ Plan: Create fetchall Script

    I'll create a new script called fetchall that extends the functionality of fetchcmds
     to fetch multiple types of content from the GitHub repository. Here's the detailed
    implementation plan:

    1. Create fetchall Script Structure

    - Base the structure on fetchcmds but extend it to handle multiple content types
    - Keep the same color-coding, error handling, and command-line option patterns
    - Maintain the same quality features (progress tracking, summary, etc.)

    2. Directory Creation

    Create these directories if they don't exist:
    - ./tools/ - for scripts from /tools/*
    - ./.claude/commands/ - for command .md files (reuse from fetchcmds)
    - ./guides/ - for guide .md files from /guides/*
    - No directory needed for movetools (it's a single file in the root)

    3. Main Features to Implement:

    a. Fetch movetools (single file)

    - Download from repos/austere-labs/collect/contents/movetools
    - Save directly to ./movetools
    - Handle as a non-.md file (raw binary/script)

    b. Fetch tools/* (4 scripts)

    - Download: createdb, extract, startmcp, uvcreate
    - Save to ./tools/ directory
    - Handle as executable scripts (preserve permissions)

    c. Fetch .claude/commands/*.md

    - Reuse existing recursive logic from fetchcmds
    - Maintain subdirectory structure (go/, python/, mcp/, tools/, archive/)
    - Save to ./.claude/commands/

    d. Fetch guides/*.md (2 files)

    - Download: PARALLEL_TESTING_GUIDE.md, YOYO_CHEAT_SHEET.md
    - Save to ./guides/ directory
    - Handle as markdown files

    4. Key Implementation Details:

    Script Structure:

    #!/bin/bash

    # GitHub repository details
    REPO="austere-labs/collect"

    # Define all fetch targets
    declare -A FETCH_TARGETS=(
        ["movetools"]="single|movetools|./movetools"
        ["tools"]="dir|tools|./tools/"
        ["commands"]="dir|.claude/commands|./.claude/commands/"
        ["guides"]="dir|guides|./guides/"
    )

    # Generic download function
    download_file() {
        local remote_path="$1"
        local local_path="$2"
        local file_type="$3"  # md or script
        # Implementation...
    }

    # Process different content types
    process_single_file() { ... }
    process_directory() { ... }
    process_md_directory() { ... }

    Enhanced Features:

    - Support the same command-line options (--force, --help, --llm)
    - Add category-based progress tracking
    - Show download summary by category
    - Handle both .md and non-.md files appropriately
    - Set executable permissions for scripts in tools/

    5. Implementation Flow:

    1. Parse command-line arguments
    2. Check prerequisites (gh CLI, jq)
    3. Create all required directories
    4. For each fetch target:
      - movetools: Download single file
      - tools/*: Download all scripts, set executable
      - .claude/commands/*.md: Recursive download (reuse fetchcmds logic)
      - guides/*.md: Download all guide files
    5. Display comprehensive summary

    6. Summary Output Format:

    Summary:
    ✓ movetools: 1 file downloaded
    ✓ tools: 4 scripts downloaded
    ✓ commands: X files downloaded, Y skipped
    ✓ guides: 2 files downloaded

    Total: N files downloaded successfully

    7. Error Handling:

    - Handle missing directories gracefully (create them)
    - Skip existing files unless --force is used
    - Report failures by category
    - Continue with other categories if one fails

    This plan maintains backward compatibility with fetchcmds patt
