# Create a pull request for the code changes I have made in this project.

## Context:
Be thoughtful, just like a Senior Principle Software Engineer would and look at the changes in code and create a good title and body for the pr 

## Task 1: Run git status if there are changes commit them  

## Task 2: Run git diff --staged to analyze the changes

## Task 3: Create a title and body for the pr based your best review of the changes

Example:
```bash
gh pr create --title "your best title here" --body "## your summary here"
```
