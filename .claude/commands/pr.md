# Create a pull request for the code changes I have made in this project.

## Context:
Be thoughtful, just like a Senior Principle Software Engineer would and look at the changes in code and either create a strong commit message or create a nice pull request based on the task instructions below:

## Task 1: Run git status if there are changes commit them  

## Task 2: Run git diff --staged to analyze the changes

## Task 3: Either create a pr or push the changes with a thoughtful commit message

    ### IF: there is no branch for the commits then go ahead and push the changes

    ### IF: There is a branch, then create a title and body for the pr based your best review of the changes  

Example:
```bash
gh pr create --title "your best title here" --body "## your summary here"
```
