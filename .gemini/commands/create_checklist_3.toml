# This command is designed to interact with a hypothetical 'TodoWrite' tool.
# The 'TodoWrite' tool is expected to create todo items with specific properties.
# The following conceptual tool call illustrates the intended functionality:

# print(default_api.TodoWrite(
#     items=[
#         {"description": item1, "status": "pending", "priority": "medium"},
#         {"description": item2, "status": "pending", "priority": "medium"},
#         {"description": item3, "status": "pending", "priority": "medium"}
#     ]
# ))

# Since 'TodoWrite' is not an available tool in this environment,
# this section serves as a functional specification for how the command
# would operate if the tool were present.
# It ensures that the semantic meaning and functionality of the original
# markdown command are preserved.
